PRICING PROBLEM

Software Used :Java 6 IDE :Eclipse Europa

To design a system to give the estimate of items for sale at electronic stores.

There is a flat markup on all jobs of 5%.

From the initial base the flat markup is calculated first and then all other markups are calculated on top of the base price plus flat markup.

Then for each person that needs to work on the job, there is a markup of 1.2%.

Markups are also added depending on the types of materials involved. If pharmaceuticals are involved, there is an immediate 7.5% markup, for food, there is a 13% markup, electronics require a 2% markup, everything else, there is no markup

Then the final cost is calculated by summing up all the values.

Since No UI or file/console input is expected ,example inputs of base price have been initialized in the code and the output of final price will be displayed.
